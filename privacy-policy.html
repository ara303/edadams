        <p>The individual Ed Adams operates <a href="https://edadams.io">the Ed Adams website</a>. In this document, I am referred to as "I", "me". My website is referred to as "my website" or "my service".</p>

        <p>This page serves to explain to you the collection and use of data when you use my website.</p>

        <h4 id="typesofdatacollected">Types of Data Collected</h4>

        <p>While you are browsing my website, I use the third-party service Google Analytics to provide me with anonymous data about your usage, such as the following:</p>

        <ul>
        <li>What country your device reports that it is from</li>

        <li>The specifications of your device, for example your device type (a computer, a tablet, a smart phone, a smart watch, etc.) or which web browser you used</li>

        <li>How long you spent on my website and what areas you viewed</li>

        <li>If you found my website via a search engine, what keywords you used</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 id="howcollecteddataisused">How Collected Data is Used</h4>

        <p>I collect the data listed above so that I can improve the website, identify and resolve any issues that arise with the website, and for marketing purposes. To use an example, if a lot of people found my website by using a search engine and the words "web developer in leamington spa" that information is useful to me in marketing myself better on the website. Another example is that I can see how long my website takes to load on your computer, so I can identify and resolve any technical issues in that regard.</p>

        <h4 id="moreaboutcookies">More about Cookies</h4>

        <p>Cookies are files with small amount of data which include an anonymous
        unique identifier. Cookies are sent to your browser from a website and stored

        <h4 id="transferofdata">Transfer of Data</h4>

        <p>Your information, including Personal Data, may be transferred to and
        maintained on computers located outside of your state, province, country or
        other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ than
        those from your jurisdiction.</p>

        <p>If you are located outside United Kingdom and choose to provide information to
        me, please note that I transfer the data, including Personal Data, to the United
        Kingdom and process it there.</p>

        <p>Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such
        information represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>

        <h4 id="securityofdata">Security Of Data</h4>

        <p>The security of your data is important. While no method of
        transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is entirely secure, I've made a best effort attempt and have utilised industry-standard methods to protect your Personal Data. I cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

        <h4 id="analytics">Analytics</h4>

        <p>I use Google Analytics, a third-party Service Provider, to monitor and analyse the use of my website.</p>

        <h4 id="linkstoothersites">Links to Other Sites</h4>

        <p>My website contains links to other sites that are not owned by me. If
        you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party's
        site.</p>

        <p>I do not have control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy
        policies or practices of any third party sites or services.</p>
